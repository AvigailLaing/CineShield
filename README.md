# CineShield
CineShield is a full-stack web security demo that simulates a media streaming platform hardened against XSS. The backend uses Express with Helmet, CSP, and DOMPurify for multi-layer sanitization; the frontend demonstrates safe DOM manipulation and input encoding. Includes documentation of reflected, stored, and DOM-based XSS attacks.
